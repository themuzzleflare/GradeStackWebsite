      <p><strong>Last Updated: April 26, 2025</strong></p>
      <p>At GradeStack, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the GradeStack app on iOS and macOS. By using GradeStack, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>
      <h2 id="1-information-we-collect">1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide the app&#39;s functionality and improve your experience. The types of information we collect are:</p>
      <h3 id="a-calendar-access">a. Calendar Access</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: GradeStack uses calendar access to add, replace, or delete calendar events related to your classes, enabling seamless integration with your system calendar.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope</strong>: We only retrieve events linked to classes created within the app. No other calendar events are accessed or stored.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage</strong>: Calendar data is used solely for syncing class-related events and is not shared or used for any other purpose.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="b-contacts-access">b. Contacts Access</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: GradeStack allows you to copy information from a selected contact to create teacher profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>iOS</strong>: You can grant fine-tuned access to specific contacts. Only the selected contact&#39;s information is retrieved and used.</li>
        <li><strong>macOS</strong>: Full contacts access is required to display a list of contacts for your selection. Only the selected contact&#39;s information is used.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope</strong>: Contact information is retrieved solely for creating teacher profiles, is used immediately, and is not stored or retained after the action is complete.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="c-camera-access-ios-only-">c. Camera Access (iOS Only)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: GradeStack uses camera access to allow you to add a photo for a teacher profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope</strong>: Camera access is only initiated when you choose to take a photo within the app. Photos are stored locally within the app and are not shared or used for any other purpose.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="d-app-performance-and-crash-data">d. App Performance and Crash Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: GradeStack uses Google Firebase to collect anonymized data about app performance and crash logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Scope</strong>: This data is used exclusively to identify and fix bugs, improve app stability, and enhance performance. It is not used to identify individual users and contains no personally identifiable information.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="2-how-we-use-your-information">2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable core app functionality, such as scheduling classes, tracking grades, and managing teacher profiles.</li>
        <li>Sync class-related events with your system calendar (if enabled).</li>
        <li>Copy selected contact information to create teacher profiles.</li>
        <li>Allow you to add photos to teacher profiles (iOS only).</li>
        <li>Monitor and improve app performance through anonymized analytics and crash reporting.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="3-data-storage-and-security">3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage</strong>: Calendar events, contact information (during use), and teacher photos are stored locally on your device within the app&#39;s secure environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Sync</strong>: If you enable iCloud Sync, your app data (e.g., semesters, subjects, assessments, classes) is securely backed up and synchronized between your iOS and macOS devices using Apple's iCloud service. GradeStack does not have access to this data.</li>
        <li><strong>Anonymized Analytics</strong>: Performance and crash data collected via Google Firebase is anonymized and stored securely, with no link to your identity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="4-data-sharing">4. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your personal information to third parties, except as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong>: Anonymized performance and crash data is shared with Google Firebase solely for app improvement purposes. This data cannot be used to identify you.</li>
        <li><strong>No Other Sharing</strong>: Calendar, contact, camera, or user-generated data (e.g., grades, schedules) is never shared with third parties.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="5-your-choices">5. Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Calendar Access</strong>: You can enable or disable calendar access through your device settings. Disabling access will prevent GradeStack from syncing class events to your calendar.</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts Access</strong>: On iOS, you can limit access to specific contacts or deny access entirely. On macOS, you can deny contacts access, which will prevent contact-based teacher profile creation. Access can be managed in your device settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Camera Access</strong>: You can deny camera access on iOS, which will prevent adding photos to teacher profiles. This can be managed in your device settings.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="6-data-retention">6. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Generated Data</strong>: Data such as semesters, subjects, assessments, classes, and teacher profiles is stored locally on your device (and in the cloud if Cloud Sync is enabled) until you choose to delete it.</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts Data</strong>: Contact information is retrieved only during the creation of a teacher profile and is immediately discarded after use.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar Data</strong>: Only class-related events are retrieved or modified, and they remain in your system calendar unless deleted by you or through the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Photos</strong>: Teacher photos are stored locally within the app and are deleted when you remove the associated teacher profile.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data</strong>: Anonymized performance and crash data may be retained by Google Firebase for analysis but is not linked to your identity.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="7-changes-to-this-privacy-policy">8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. We will notify you of significant changes by updating the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at the top of this policy and, where required, through in-app notifications. Your continued use of GradeStack after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
